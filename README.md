- Predicts stock prices using machine learning algorithms.

2. **[GitHub Analytics Dashboard](https://app-repository-analytics-dashboard-3lzt68td3o2amm4jhip6vv.streamlit.app/)**
- Analyzes and visualizes GitHub repository data.

3. **[Music API in Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/byhringjstudent/API-Django-Rest)**
- This music API is ready to receive songs, albums, and artists.

4. **[HTML5 Feature using CDN Library](https://github.com/byhringjstudent/HTML5-Feature)**
- This Web Based Game coded in HTML5 demonstrates the use of JS Libraries.
Projects:

5. **[Card Shuffling and Dealing Simulation](https://stock-predictor-app-mqwmxskm5sj5aakmxztdws.streamlit.app/)**
- This project leverages object-oriented principles to simulate a deck of cards, encapsulating internal data representation and employing name mangling for simulating private attributes.
- The DeckOfCards class provides features for shuffling, dealing, and visualizing cards using the Matplotlib library of features, demonstrating a robust and interactive card game simulation with card images.

This version includes:

    Object-oriented principles: Explicitly mentions the use of object-oriented programming.
    Internal data representation: Highlights the encapsulation of data within the DeckOfCards class.
    Name mangling: Shows awareness of this technique for simulating private attributes.
    Feature creation of class: Mentions shuffling, dealing, and visualization as features of the class.
    Robust and interactive: Emphasizes the quality and interactivity of the simulation.

6. **[Twitter(X) Streaming API](https://github.com/byhringjstudent/)**
